In fact, over 90% worry about going to school during their time of the month, often for risk of leaking and being made fun of by their peers. This shame doesn\u2019t stop when they become adults and move into the professional world either \u2013 did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/metro.co.uk\/2019\/11\/15\/a-third-of-men-think-its-unprofessional-to-talk-about-periods-at-work-11149780\/\">a third of CIS men think it\u2019s unprofessional for us to talk about periods at work<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re here to tell you that we disagree! Our periods are a perfectly normal, regular part of a lot of people\u2019s lives. Periods shouldn\u2019t have to be ignored, shoved under the carpet, or treated as something we should be ashamed of. That\u2019s why we started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/walmart-call-on-supermarkets-to-stop-using-feminine-hygiene-to-describe-period-products?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=d3de3200-e855-11ea-b69a-13a63bf5c497\">this petition<\/a>. We actually think there are a bunch of benefits to talking about your period \u2013 in the office, at school, on the bus\u2026 &#8211; wherever you are! Here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Smash the taboo<\/span><\/em><\/strong><br>One of the reasons a period taboo still exists is because it\u2019s treated like a secret \u2013 the less people talk about something, the more uncomfortable it feels when somebody brings it up. It\u2019s like when you go on holiday and the temperature feels uncomfortable at first, but a couple of days of being exposed to the heat means you get used to it. The best thing we can do to reduce the stigma surrounding periods is to talk about them openly and frequently.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Better education<\/span><\/em><\/strong><br>With communication, comes understanding. Not only can we talk to other people <em>with <\/em>periods to learn about similarities and differences between cycles, we can also talk to those <em>without<\/em> them, helping them to gain a better understanding of what happens to our bodies every month and why. Three quarters of children aren\u2019t satisfied with the education on periods they receive, but after learning, they stop discussing periods altogether, putting their already insufficient period education to a grinding halt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">For your safety<\/span><\/em><\/strong><br>If you\u2019re suffering as a result of your period, and you need to ask for help or call in sick, you should be able to feel comfortable giving an honest answer about what you\u2019re experiencing. Did you know that endometriosis takes an average of 7.5 years to diagnose? Talking about your period confidently, and with no reservations might help doctors get to the bottom of your pain faster. It will also help employers, colleagues or teachers to better understand the situation you\u2019re in. Talking about your period more could help you to find a solution to your pain, keeping you safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Bonding<\/span><\/em><\/strong><br>Your period shouldn\u2019t be something you have to endure alone, and it can actually be a great way to feel closer to those around you. Whether they go through the same thing (they know the feeling!) or help you to make your period that little bit easier to manage (thank GOD they\u2019re in our lives), periods are better when you can talk about them with the people you\u2019re surrounded by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Why not?<\/span><\/em><\/strong><br>Repeat after us: There is nothing gross about periods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to moan about your cramps, explain why you\u2019re a little teary, or give an honest reason why you can\u2019t come into work. We say: why on earth not?! We all know periods happen, they\u2019re entirely normal, and around half of us experience them month on month, so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem when it comes to talking about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Natracare, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to just talk about periods openly, we believe it\u2019s also essential to discuss the period products we use, and more precisely: what\u2019s in them. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.natracare.com\/products\/\">period products<\/a> are plastic free, vegan and biodegradable \u2013 better for your vagina and the planet!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natracare started in 1989 when founder, Susie Hewson, created the world\u2019s first 100% organic cotton tampon. Since then, Natracare has been designing and producing products that are kind to our bodies and the planet. Natracare products are plastic free, biodegradable, and compostable, just the way they should be!<\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--StartFragment--><\/p>\n<p><!--EndFragment--><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The following post is a guest blog post written by<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":263976,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[270],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/263975"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=263975"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/263975\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/263976"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=263975"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=263975"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=263975"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
