Despite this, there is unfortunately a serious lack of resources that promote menstruation and don\u2019t present it as something to be ashamed of. Knowledge is power, and with that can come the desire to educate and share information to create a worldwide shame-free sisterhood where we celebrate our time of the month together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was an adolescent teenager prior to getting my first period there were no resources (that I knew of) available at my school. Periods weren\u2019t discussed in any way other than a whisper to a teacher to let them know that you had to rush to the bathroom, because it was \u201cthat time of the month\u201d. If there had been a curriculum in place that openly discussed menstruation then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt such shame or embarrassment the few times that I discovered I had gotten my period in the middle of sports class. \u201cI could just die,\u201d I recall telling one of my close friends. Why? Because periods were seen as gross, dirty things that shouldn\u2019t be talked about. There was no education, no normalisation that made me feel like what I was experiencing was okay. But the truth is that it was normal, there just wasn\u2019t anyone letting me know that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading about periods and educating yourself is something that should happen at any age, not just before or while you\u2019re experiencing your first period. Whether you\u2019ve been menstruating for years, just started, or are the parents of a budding menstruator, educating yourself on the whole period of experience (pun intended) is important to stop the cycle of shame and let people with periods know that they are not alone. There is a support system out there, and despite the lack of resources, we are here to help each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few of our picks that educate, promote, share and amuse in order to debunk myths surrounding menstruation, and focus on the right that we should all have to live equally with access to the products we deserve. Because we\u2019re powerful beings and deserve nothing less!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>\u2018Heavy Flow\u2019 Amanda Laird<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Challenging and breaking down menstruation myths, this must-read has been described by author, holistic nutritionist and feminist <a href=\"http:\/\/amandalaird.ca\/heavy-flow-breaking-the-curse-of-menstruation\/\">Amanda Laird<\/a>, as \u201cthe menstrual education you didn\u2019t get in health class\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book provides a crash course on the history of menstrual shame, examining how this has had a direct impact on women\u2019s health &amp; wellness in the modern age.
