Several women have made their mark on our history, creating inventions and discoveries that we could not do without.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s just look at a few of them whom most of us have probably never heard of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color:#0071a1\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><strong>Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner<\/strong><br><\/span><\/span>Reading about this woman I am totally blown away. Most people, (including google BTW) credit Benjamin Franklin with the invention of the menstrual pad. We have not been told that this &#8220;revolutionary\u201d liberating contraption was invented by a woman who is noted to have <a href=\"https:\/\/prochoicemissouri.org\/2020\/02\/24\/pioneering-black-inventor-radically-changed-menstrual-pad\/#:~:text=In%201957%2C%20Mary%20Beatrice%20Davidson,and%20rags%20during%20their%20period.\">filed more patents than any other African American woman in history.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0071a1\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Josephine Cochrane<\/strong><br><\/span><\/span>How grateful should we be to Josephine for not having to wash our dishes by hand? She was the inventor of the first commercially available dish washer in the late 1800s. However, it was not until the 1950s that dishwashers became a common household item after new suburban homes were built with the plumbing required to handle the extra hot water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0071a1\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Mary Anderson<\/strong><br><\/span><\/span>On November 10, 1903 Mary Anderson was granted her first patent for an automatic car window cleaning device controlled from inside the car; we know it as the windshield wiper. Although the invention was a life saver, she actually had trouble selling her invention at first. <a href=\"https:\/\/kids.kiddle.co\/Josephine_Cochrane\">It was not until 1922 that Cadillac eventually included her invention in its vehicles.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0071a1\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biography.com\/news\/famous-women-inventors-biography\">Caresse Crosby<\/a><\/strong><br><\/span><\/span>Women have literally breathed easier thanks to Caresse Crosby. In 1910 she was feeling irritated with having to wear the restrictive corset that women customarily wore beneath their clothing. In 1914 she received a patent for her idea and a few years later she founded the Fashion Form Brassiere Company to manufacture and sell the first bra invention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would not mind being any of these women for a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are hundreds of technologies and devices that we depend on every day. Many of them were invented by women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who do you want to be this Halloween?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What technologies or inventions can you not live without?<\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--StartFragment--><\/p>\n<p><!--EndFragment--><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Halloween is around the corner, I thought it might<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":270622,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[270],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/270621"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=270621"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/270621\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/270622"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=270621"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=270621"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mylivia.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=270621"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
